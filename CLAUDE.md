# dbt-semantic-mcp

DuckDB + dbt medallion marts + a governed semantic layer (MetricFlow), exposed to agents over MCP

**Tier**: T1  **Language**: python  **Test discipline**: pragmatic

This file is **read by every Claude Code session** that opens this repo.
Keep it short, scannable, and load-bearing. Long-form prose belongs in
`docs/`. Personal scratch notes (TODOs, ad-hoc commands, half-formed
ideas) belong in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored).

## What this is

One paragraph. Why the project exists, what it does, what it intentionally
does NOT do. Update when the answer changes.

## Build / test / lint

All verbs go through `just`. Never run the underlying tool directly in
docs — that creates two sources of truth.

```sh
just            # list all recipes
just fmt        # auto-format
just lint       # lint (warnings → errors)
just test       # run tests per discipline (pragmatic)
just build      # build release artifact
just check      # fmt + lint + test (the merge gate)
```

Tier-2 release path:

```sh
just release patch    # tag + push (CI does the build/sign/SBOM/SLSA)
just release minor
just release major
```

## Architecture

Three to five bullets. Where the code lives, what each top-level dir
does, key invariants a newcomer can't infer from a `tree` listing.
Update when the layout changes.

- `src/` — primary source
- `tests/` — see test-discipline (pragmatic)
- `docs/` — long-form docs; ADRs in `docs/adr/`
- `.github/workflows/` — CI; SHA-pinned actions

## Conventions

- **Conventional Commits**, signed (`git commit -sS`).
- **Lockfile committed**.
- **Pre-commit installed** — `pre-commit install` once after clone.
- **GitHub Actions pinned by SHA** — Renovate / Dependabot keeps fresh.
- **Container base images pinned by digest** if any.
- **Structured logging** — no `print()` / `console.log` in committed code.
